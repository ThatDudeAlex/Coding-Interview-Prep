## One Edit

You're given two strings stringOne and stringTwo.
Write a function that determines if these two strings can be made equal
using only one edit.

There are 3 possible edits:



Note that both strings will contain at least one character. If the strings
are the same, your function should return true.

### Sample Input
```
stringOne = "hello"
stringTwo = "hollo"
```

### Sample Output
```
True // A single replace at index 1 of either string can make the strings equal
```
