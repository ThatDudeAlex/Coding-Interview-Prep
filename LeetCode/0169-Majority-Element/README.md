# 169. Majority Element

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the **majority element**.

The **majority element** is the element that appears more than \( \lfloor n / 2 \rfloor \) times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints:

- \( n == \text{nums.length} \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4 \)
- \( -10^9 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^9 \)

### Follow-up:
Could you solve the problem in linear time and in \( O(1) \) space?
