# Cracking the Coding Interview - Data Structures and Algorithms Implementations

This directory provides implementations of essential `data structures` and `algorithms` as outlined on page 61 of "Cracking the Coding Interview." It's designed as a resource for anyone preparing for technical interviews or looking to strengthen their understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

| Data Structures        | Algorithms           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Linked Lists           | Breadth-First Search |
| Trees, Tries, & Graphs | Depth-First Search   |
| Stacks & Queues        | Binary Search        |
| Heaps                  | Merge Sort           |
| Vectors/Arraylists     | Quick Sort           |
| Hash Tables            | 
```

**Why These Concepts Matter**

Mastering these data structures and algorithms is crucial for:

* **Solving coding problems efficiently:** You'll learn how to choose the right data structure for a task and optimize algorithm performance.

* **Understanding how things work under the hood:** Gain deeper insights into the building blocks of software.

**Implementations**

The implementations will be organized by language in separate directories. Currently planned languages include:

* Java

* JavaScript

* Python

* Go
