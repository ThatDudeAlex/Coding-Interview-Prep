## Sort Stack

Write a function that takes in an array of integers representing a stack,
recursively sorts the stack in place (i.e., doesn't create a brand new array),
and returns it.

The array must be treated as a stack, with the end of the array as the top of
the stack. Therefore, you're only allowed to

You're not allowed to perform any other operations on the input array,
including accessing elements (except for the last element), moving elements,
etc.. You're also not allowed to use any other data structures, and your
solution must be recursive.

### Sample Input
```
stack = [-5, 2, -2, 4, 3, 1]
```

### Sample Output
```
[-5, -2, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
