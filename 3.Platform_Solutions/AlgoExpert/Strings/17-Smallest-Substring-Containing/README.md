## Smallest Substring Containing

You're given two non-empty strings: a big string and a small string. Write a
function that returns the smallest substring in the big string that contains
all of the small string's characters.

Note that:

You can assume that there will only be one relevant smallest substring.

### Sample Input
```
bigString = "abcd$ef$axb$c$"
smallString = "$$abf"
```

### Sample Output
```
"f$axb$"
```
