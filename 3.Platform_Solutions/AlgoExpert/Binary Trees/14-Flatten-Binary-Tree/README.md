## Flatten Binary Tree

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree, flattens it, and returns its
leftmost node.

A flattened Binary Tree is a structure that's nearly identical to a Doubly
Linked List (except that nodes have left and
right pointers instead of prev and
next pointers), where nodes follow the original tree's
left-to-right order.

Note that if the input Binary Tree happens to be a valid Binary Search Tree,
the nodes in the flattened tree will be sorted.

The flattening should be done in place, meaning that the original data
structure should be mutated (no new structure should be created).

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a
left child node, and a right child node. Children
nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or
None / null.

### Sample Input
```
tree =      1
         /     \
        2       3
      /   \   /
     4     5 6
          / \
         7   8
```

### Sample Output
```
4 <-> 2 <-> 7 <-> 5 <-> 8 <-> 1 <-> 6 <-> 3 // the leftmost node with value 4
```
